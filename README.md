TestGreen Script
================

This is just a simple groovy script that takes a plain text file that is in a
"sort-of" Markdown format and emits HTML that can then be used where needed.

I tried to use some java markdown processors and was not quite happy with 
what I found. Hence the need to create my own groovy script. 

The intented purpose was just to use it for my own internal needs. I felt
more comfortable writing blog posts and other documentations in Markdown and
then translate them to HTML as needed.
